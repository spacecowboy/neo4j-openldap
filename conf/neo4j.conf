# Enable this to specify a parser other than the default one.
#cypher.default_language_version=3.0

# Limit the number of IOs the background checkpoint process will consume per second.
# This setting is advisory, is ignored in Neo4j Community Edition, and is followed to
# best effort in Enterprise Edition.
# An IO is in this case a 8 KiB (mostly sequential) write. Limiting the write IO in
# this way will leave more bandwidth in the IO subsystem to service random-read IOs,
# which is important for the response time of queries when the database cannot fit
# entirely in memory. The only drawback of this setting is that longer checkpoint times
# may lead to slightly longer recovery times in case of a database or system crash.
# A lower number means lower IO pressure, and consequently longer checkpoint times.
# The configuration can also be commented out to remove the limitation entirely, and
# let the checkpointer flush data as fast as the hardware will go.
# Set this to -1 to disable the IOPS limit.
